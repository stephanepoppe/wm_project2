## Build 

To compile Magnific Popup by yourself, first of make sure that you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), [Grunt.js](https://github.com/cowboy/grunt), [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/) and [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/) installed, then:

1) Copy repository

	git clone https://github.com/dimsemenov/Magnific-Popup.git

2) Go inside Magnific Popup folder that you fetched and install Node dependencies

	cd Magnific-Popup && npm install

3) Now simply run `grunt` to generate JS and CSS in folder `dist` and site in folder `_site/`.

	grunt

Optionally:

- Run `grunt watch` to automatically rebuild script when you change files in `src/` or in `website/`.
- If you don't have and don't want to install Jekyll, run `grunt nosite` to just build JS and CSS files related to popup in `dist/`.

## License

Script is MIT licensed and free and will always be kept this way. But has a small restriction from me - please do not create public WordPress plugin based on it(or at least contact me before creating it), because I will make it and it'll be open source too ([want to get notified?](http://dimsemenov.com/subscribe.html)).
